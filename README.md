# Warnings

* With the new versions starting with 0.3.0 pushed recently, I have tried to deal with an automatic upgrade to the next version, for example 0.2.1 to 0.3.0 or 0.3.0 to 0.4.0 but not 0.2.1 to 0.4.0. Even if I have done a lot of test, take a full backup before!
* Starting with version 0.4.0, the Postgresql image used is now 9.6-alpine, so an upgrade step is necessary between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0. A special docker-compose file is included in the 0.4.0 git, that will bring online two containers (don't forget to adapt the paths to your environment) :
  * One with Posgresql 9.4 with the current data
  * A second with Postgresql 9.6

  But doing everything, take a full backup before!  
  When the container are up, attach a shell to the one running Postgresql 9.4 and issue the following command:  
 Â `pg_dumpall -U postgres | psql -h postgres96 -U postgres`  
  After that, stop the containers, adapt the paths in docker-compose.yml to your environment and you can build and start the containers, everything should work.

# Quick Start

* Check out the git repository
